          "We present the results of a survey of 248 software practitioners conducted in three phases ten years apart. The goal of the study is to uncover trends in the practice of software design and the adoption patterns of modeling languages such as UML. The first phase was conducted in April-December 2007 and included 113 responses. The second phase was conducted in March-November 2017 and included 115 responses. The third phase is a post-survey study was conducted in November 2018 and included additional questionnaires with 20 participants. All survey phases were conducted online, employed identical solicitation mechanisms, and included the same set of questions. The survey results are analyzed within each phase and across phases. We present the results and analysis of the data identifying upward and downward trends in design and modeling practices. The results indicate a significant increase in the use of well-defined and formal modeling languages, as well as a marked increase in the adoption of Domain-Specific Languages. This is also reflected in a significant increase in the adoption of forward engineering methodologies. A key motivation for this uptake is a concern that programming languages and platforms may become quickly outdated. Unfortunately, there has been a consistent dissatisfaction with modeling tools features, particularly their ability to support effective communication and collaboration. This is mirrored by increasing dissatisfaction with modeling tools usability and learnability. Future projections of this study suggest that diversity in modeling languages and tools is likely to continue to grow, as well as the increase in reliance on models for automated artifacts generation. As such, model and tool interoperability is likely to become an even greater concern for the years to come. The results of this study can help researchers, practitioners, and educators to focus efforts on issues of relevance and significance to the profession. Specifically, this research will advocate to build better software modeling tools and promote modeling to the educators.",

MLTDD can be applied to programming languages, preprocessors, domain specific languages, and transformation engines.

This paper presents a new approach that transforms a composite state machine into an equivalent set of simple state machines before code generation.

This approach embeds the action language into a textual environment that includes the UML modeling elements. Unlike current action languages that typically address class diagrams only, our proposal includes class and state machine modeling abstractions as part of the action language. We tackle the problem of modeling-in-text not by introducing yet another programming language, but instead by providing an increased level of abstraction to existing high level programming languages.

This is because results are unlikely to be globally applicable, but are more likely to apply only in certain contexts such as the type of software on which the evidence has been tested. We present a software taxonomy that should help researchers to apply their research systematically to particular types of software. The taxonomy was generated using existing partial taxonomies and input from survey participants. If a taxonomy such as ours gains acceptance, it will facilitate comparison and appropriate application of research. In the paper, we present the benefits of such a taxonomy, the process we used to develop it, and the taxonomy itself.",

The aim of the survey was to uncover their attitudes and experiences regarding software modeling, and development approaches that avoid modeling. We were motivated by observations that modeling is not widely adopted; many developers continue to take a code-centric approach. Key findings overall include: Modeling tools are primarily used to create documentation and for up-front design with little code generation; and participants believe that model-centric approaches to software engineering are easier but are currently not very popular as most participants currently work in code-centric environments. Key findings from sub-samples include: problems identified with model-centric approaches are similar regardless of a participant's country. Programmers that model extensively (versus those that do not model much) are more likely to agree that models become out of date and inconsistent with code.",

At times, they need to reuse the same coding constructs, library access, method calls, and web services.

Understanding the normative practice of software engineering is the first step toward developing realistic solutions to better facilitate the engineering process. We conducted three studies using several data-gathering approaches to elucidate the patterns by which software engineers (SEs) use and update documentation. Our objective is to more accurately comprehend and model documentation use, usefulness, and maintenance, thus enabling better decision making and tool design by developers and project managers. Our results confirm the widely held belief that SEs typically do not update documentation as timely or completely as software process personnel and managers advocate. However, the results also reveal that out-of-date software documentation remains useful in many circumstances.",

In fact, documentation engineering has become a popular sub-domain in the software engineering community. Unfortunately, the current perception of documentation is that it is outdated, irrelevant and incomplete. For the most part, this perception is probably true. Regrettably, the documentation concern cannot be resolved by simply mandating more and better documentation. This approach fails to resolve the problem as the solution ignores the fundamental goals of software engineering. The role of documentation in a software engineering environment is to communicate information to its audience and instil knowledge of the system it describes. Documentation should efficiently allow for future software development without hindering current progress. Our research focuses on the issue of documentation quality. In particular, which attributes of documentation make it effective to the audience and how can this information be monitored and parameterized to provide a better perspective about the relevance of documentation in a software project.",

One of the goals of this survey was to uncover the perceived relevance (or lack thereof) of software documentation, and the tools and technologies used to maintain, verify and validate such documents. The survey results highlight the preferences for and aversions against software documentation tools. Participants agree that documentation tools should seek to better extract knowledge from core resources. These resources include the system‚Äôs source code, test code and changes to both. Resulting technologies could then help reduce the effort required for documentation mainte-nance, something that is shown to rarely occur.
